<!-- ### What I've been working on lately:
1. Job hunting
1. Audit personal website using [html-validator ](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
1. Seek to connect [my front end capstone](https://github.com/gradyrobbins/fifty) project to Persistent Data Storage; using a json-server does not meet customer's needs
1. Browse open source GIS repositories & tutorials. -->

<!-- Concrete vs. Abstract Thinkers:
Concrete: I don't understand the concepts and I am stuck here.  Ask for specific code examples and a whiteboard visualization of how the pieces fit together.
Abstract:  focus on effectively researching a concept; it's okay to get hints on how to focus your search.  ask:  "I've done some research, but am having trouble relating it to something we've already learned" -->


<!-- The Auburn Creed
I believe that this is a practical world and that I can count only on what I earn. Therefore, I believe in work, hard work.

I believe in education, which gives me the knowledge to work wisely and trains my mind and my hands to work skillfully.

I believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the respect and confidence of my fellow men.

I believe in a sound mind, in a sound body and a spirit that is not afraid, and in clean sports that develop these qualities.

I believe in obedience to law because it protects the rights of all.

I believe in the human touch, which cultivates sympathy with my fellow men and mutual helpfulness and brings happiness for all.

I believe in my Country, because it is a land of freedom and because it is my own home, and that I can best serve that country by "doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with my God."

And because Auburn men and women believe in these things, I believe in Auburn and love it.

-George Petrie (1943) -->
